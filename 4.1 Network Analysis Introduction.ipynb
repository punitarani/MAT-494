    "## Graph Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Graph** is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect the nodes.\n",
    "It is represented as a pair of sets $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Directed Graph** is a graph where the edges have a direction.\n",
    "Conversely, An **Undirected Graph** is a graph where the edges do not have a direction.\n",
    "**Mixed Graphs** are graphs that contain both directed and undirected edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Path** is a sequence of nodes that are connected by edges.\n",
    "- A **Cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Tree** is a graph that has no cycles.\n",
    "- A **Forest** is a graph that has no cycles and is connected.\n",
    "- A **Spanning Tree** is a tree that contains all the nodes in the graph.\n",
    "- A **Spanning Forest** is a forest that contains all the nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **n-hop neighborhood** of a node is the set of nodes that are at most $n$ hops away from the node.\n",
    "- The **degree** of a node is the number of edges that are connected to the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Models for Social Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Networks are best represented as **Graphs** where the nodes are the users and the edges are the relationships between the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Social Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facebook\n",
    "  - Nodes: Users\n",
    "  - Edges: Friendship\n",
    "  - Degree: Number of friends\n",
    "- Twitter\n",
    "  - In-degree: Number of followers\n",
    "  - Out-degree: Number of following"
